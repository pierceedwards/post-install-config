### 4. Configure SLA Plans and Help Topics

**SLA Plans** define how quickly tickets should be responded to and resolved. **Help Topics** help end-users select the issue category during ticket submission.

- Navigate to: **Admin Panel > Manage > SLA Plans**
  - Add entries like "Standard (48hr)", "Urgent (4hr)"

- Navigate to: **Admin Panel > Manage > Help Topics**
  - Add topics like "Network Issue", "Password Reset", "Software Installation"

![Help Topics](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce8301d2-1809-41f8-a584-6678258f4802)

Assign SLA plans and help topics to streamline ticket categorization and priority.
